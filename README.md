# Description
Used to hack a windows computer (Linux too only if it's running in wine)  
and steal certain files from it.

# Detection
It's fully undetected to all the antiviruses of the world as of now.

# Working
When it starts, it searches the whole computer for files which are of 
certain extensions. If found, it uploads all those files to an FTP 
server of your choice.
After that, it quits. 

# Updates
It has no modules for persistance, no auto-startup capabilities, 
no resume capabilities and shows a command prompt window too.
For best possible stealth experience and additions, please contact 
and support the developer as it reqiures time and effort :)
DONATIONS are Accepted via PayPal, Perfect Money and Bitcoin.

# HAPPY HACKING 3:)
