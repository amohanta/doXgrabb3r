# doXgrabb3r


# Description
Used to hack a windows computer (Linux too only if it's running in wine)

# Detection
It's fully undetected to all the antiviruses of the world as of now.

# Working
When it starts, it searches the whole computer for files which are of 
certain extensions. If found, it uploads all those files to an FTP 
server of your choice.
After that, it quits. 

# Updates
It has no modules for persistnce and shows a command window too.
For best possible stealth experience and additions,
please contact the developer if you are willing to PAY right! :)

# HAPPY HACKING 3:)
